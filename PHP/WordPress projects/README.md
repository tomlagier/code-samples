This is a complete theme, written custom for a client (with which we do not have an NDA!). It's loosely based on the Leisure template, but all PHP and most of the JS/CSS are written by me.

You can see the Leisure template at: http://themeforest.net/item/leisure-hotel-resort-spa-html-template/8368130

All of the PHP, theme functions, widgets, etc is written by me. I piggybacked off of the Leisure stylesheet, and re-implemented their core script files.
